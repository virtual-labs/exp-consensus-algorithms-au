<u><h3>Procedure</h3></u>

 <p>In this simulation, we will explore two different consensus algorithms, Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, within the context of an election use case. </p>

You have the option to choose between PoW and PoS, which will be simulated in the context of an election scenario.  
<p>In the PoW scenario,</p> 
<u><p><b>Verifying the Legitimacy of Votes</b></p></u>

1. Read the instructions carefully and click the 'Start' button to begin the process
2. You will encounter a voter login page. Fill in the required information and click the 'Login' button and  the simulation begins.

<u><p><b>Public Verification</b></p></u>

12. After voting, a table with your name, time, and vote status will be shown for public verification, marking the end of the process.

<p>(Please note that the tampering condition is randomly assigned. To experience both scenarios, you can refresh the process. Remember to read the instructions carefully and proceed through each step.)</p>


<p>In the PoS scenario,</p> 


 <u><b><p> Stakeholder Influence</p></b></u>

 
  
  1. Three channels featuring election news are given. Students can explore and review the content by clicking on the channel button.click the 'Close' button to proceed to the next step

5. Access the candidate verification page where students can role-play as Election authorities. To modify the verification status, click on the checkbox next to the candidate's name. After making the desired changes, click the 'Submit' button to return to the updated candidate verification status page. <br>

<u><b><p>  Validation and verification</p></b></u>

<br>

7. Students can simulate the role of voters here. To cast a vote, enter your credentials on the voter verification page and then click the 'Verify' button to confirm your identity.<br>

 9. Navigate to the vote counting page. To retrieve the serial number of voting machine, click on the 'Get Serial Number' button, and it will populate in the input box.<br>
 10. click the 'Count' button to count the votes, and the total number of votes for each candidate will be displayed.<br>
 11. For a recount, press the second 'Get Serial Number' button (it will provide the same serial number as before) and then hit the 'Recount' button. If both counts match, a 'Vote Count verified' message will appear.This is the final step of pos based election simulation<br>
